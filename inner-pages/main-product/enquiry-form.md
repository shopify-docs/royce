# Enquiry Form

The **Enquiry Form** section allows customers to submit questions or requests directly from the product or page. It’s ideal for custom orders, bulk enquiries, or pre-purchase questions, helping you capture leads and respond efficiently.

By adding the enquiry form block, the form gets added. Then we can customize the image for the form.
