# Featured Product

The **Featured Products** section allows you to highlight selected products on your homepage or any other page. It’s perfect for showcasing **best-sellers**, **new arrivals**, or **promotional items**, making it easier for customers to discover key products at a glance.

**To add this section:**

1. In your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store > Themes**.
2. Click **Customize** on your active theme.
3. In the theme editor, click **Add section** and select **Featured Products**.

You can then configure the section settings to choose which products to display and customize the layout to match your store’s design.
