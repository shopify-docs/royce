# Support Policy

We are committed to providing exceptional support and look forward to assisting you to the best of our abilities. This support policy details the level of assistance you can expect from us. By using our Shopify themes, you agree to this support policy. We reserve the right to amend our support policy at any time without prior notice. Support Policies: A supported item includes item support for 6 months from the purchase date. During those 6 months, we are expected to be available to provide the item support services. You’ll also have the option to purchase extended item support, increasing the item support period up to a maximum of 12 months from the date of purchase. We do not provide support for Envato Element subscription users. If you need support from us, then you need to buy the theme from Themeforest. You can refer to our theme documentation to fix your query. Contact Us. We welcome your questions or feedback regarding this Support Policy and our themes.

**Support Language:** Our support services are provided exclusively in **English**. If you submit a request in a different language, we will try to translate it using an online translation service; however, our responses will be in English.
