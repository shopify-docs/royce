<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot_74 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Shopify is web based ecommerce software. This means there’s no installation required, and it works with all operating systems (including **Windows and MacOS**)! Shopify hosts the site itself, so you don’t have to worry about installing, upgrading or maintaining any software or web servers.

Visit [https://www.shopify.com/(opens in a new tab)](https://www.shopify.com/) to install Shopify and [https://www.shopify.com/in/partners](https://www.shopify.com/in/partners)
