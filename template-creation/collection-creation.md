# Collection Creation

Kindly follow the instructions to create and manage collections for your store. You can organize products into groups based on categories, tags, or conditions to help customers browse more easily. Setting up collections correctly improves navigation, enhances the shopping experience, and ensures your catalogue is structured clearly for better sales performance.

***

### Step 1: **Go to the Collections Page**

1. Log in to your **Shopify admin**.
2. From the left sidebar, click **Products**.
3. Select **Collections**.
4. Click **Create collection** (top right).

***

### Step 2: **Add Basic Collection Details**

1. **Collection title** — Enter the name of your collection (e.g., “Summer Collection”).
2. **Description** — Add optional details or promotional text (appears at the top of the collection page, depending on your theme).
3. **Collection image** (optional) — Upload an image that represents the collection.

***

### Step 3: **Choose Collection Type**

Shopify offers two types of collections:

#### **A. Manual Collection**

You manually add products one by one.\
Use this when you want full control (e.g., curated picks, featured items).

* Select **Manual**.
* After saving, scroll down and click **Browse** to add products.

#### **B. Automated Collection**

Products are added automatically based on conditions you set.\
Helpful for categories like “Red Dresses,” “Under $50,” or “Kids Toys.”

* Select **Automated**.
* Choose one or more **conditions** (e.g., Product tag contains “Summer”).
* Set rules like **All conditions** or **Any condition**.
* Products matching those rules will auto-populate.

***

### Step 4: **Set Visibility**

Choose when the collection should appear in your store:

* **Active** — Visible immediately
* **Draft** — Hidden
* **Schedule** — Set a date and time to publish

***

### Step 5: **Search Engine Listing (SEO)**

1. Click **Edit website SEO**.
2. Update the **page title**, **meta description**, and **URL handle** if needed.\
   This helps search engines better understand the collection.

***

### Step 6: **Save Your Collection**

Click **Save** at the top right.

***

### Step 7: **Add the Collection to Your Navigation (Optional)**

If you want customers to access it from your menu:

1. Go to **Online Store → Navigation**.
2. Choose the menu (e.g., Main menu).
3. Click **Add menu item**.
4. Enter a name and select **Collections → \[Your Collection]**.
5. Save the menu.
