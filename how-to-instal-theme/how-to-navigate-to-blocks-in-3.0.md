# How to navigate to blocks in 3.0?

Shopify 3.0 makes it easy to locate and edit specific sections or blocks directly from the storefront preview using the Inspector feature.

**Steps to Navigate to a Block**

1. Log in to your **Shopify Admin**.
2. Go to **Online Store → Themes**.
3. Click **Edit theme** on your active theme to open the Theme Editor.
4. Ensure the **Inspector** mode is enabled (it is enabled by default).
5. In the live preview, hover over any element such as text, a button, a heading, or an image.
6. Click the highlighted element.
7. Shopify will automatically focus and open the corresponding **section or block** in the settings panel on the left.

**Editing the Block**

* Update content such as text, images, or links.
* Adjust styling options available for that specific block.
* Changes are reflected instantly in the preview.

This workflow helps you quickly identify and modify the exact element you want without manually searching through sections or blocks.
